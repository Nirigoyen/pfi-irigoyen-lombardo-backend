This sample hook safeguards topic branches that have been
published from being rewound.

The workflow assumed here is:

 * Once a topic branch forks from "master", "master" is never
   merged into it again (either directly or indirectly).

 * Once a topic branch is fully cooked and merged into "master",
   it is deleted.  If you need to build on top of it to correct
   earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at
   the tip of the "master".  This is not strictly necessary, but
   it makes it easier to keep your history simple.

 * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic
   branches, merge them into "next" branch.

The script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name
to be "next", but it is trivial to make it configurable via
$GIT_DIR/config mechanism.

With this workflow, you would want to know:

(1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to "next".  Young
    topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather
    clean up before publishing, and things that have not been
    merged into other branches can be easily rebased without
    affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would
    not want to rewind it.

(2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to "master".
    Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not
    build on top of it -- other people may already want to
    change things related to the topic as patches against your
    "master", so if you need further changes, it is better to
    fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the
    tip of "master".

Let's look at this example:

		   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "next"
		  /       /           /           /
		 /   a---a---b A     /           /
		/   /               /           /
	       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /
	      /   /   /             \         /
	     /   /   /   b---b C     \       /
	    /   /   /   /             \     /
    ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "master"


A, B and C are topic branches.

 * A has one fix since it was merged up to "next".

 * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to "master" and "next",
   and is ready to be deleted.

 * C has not merged to "next" at all.

We would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage
B to be deleted.

To compute (1):

	git rev-list ^master ^topic next
	git rev-list ^master        next

	if these match, topic has not merged in next at all.

To compute (2):

	git rev-list master..topic

	if this is empty, it is fully merged to "master".

--- File: .git\hooks\prepare-commit-msg.sample ---
#!/bin/sh
#
# An example hook script to prepare the commit log message.
# Called by "git commit" with the name of the file that has the
# commit message, followed by the description of the commit
# message's source.  The hook's purpose is to edit the commit
# message file.  If the hook fails with a non-zero status,
# the commit is aborted.
#
# To enable this hook, rename this file to "prepare-commit-msg".

# This hook includes three examples. The first one removes the
# "# Please enter the commit message..." help message.
#
# The second includes the output of "git diff --name-status -r"
# into the message, just before the "git status" output.  It is
# commented because it doesn't cope with --amend or with squashed
# commits.
#
# The third example adds a Signed-off-by line to the message, that can
# still be edited.  This is rarely a good idea.

--- File: .git\hooks\push-to-checkout.sample ---
#!/bin/sh

# An example hook script to update a checked-out tree on a git push.
#
# This hook is invoked by git-receive-pack(1) when it reacts to git
# push and updates reference(s) in its repository, and when the push
# tries to update the branch that is currently checked out and the
# receive.denyCurrentBranch configuration variable is set to
# updateInstead.
#
# By default, such a push is refused if the working tree and the index
# of the remote repository has any difference from the currently
# checked out commit; when both the working tree and the index match
# the current commit, they are updated to match the newly pushed tip
# of the branch. This hook is to be used to override the default
# behaviour; however the code below reimplements the default behaviour
# as a starting point for convenient modification.
#
# The hook receives the commit with which the tip of the current
# branch is going to be updated:
commit=$1

# It can exit with a non-zero status to refuse the push (when it does
# so, it must not modify the index or the working tree).
die () {
	echo >&2 "$*"
	exit 1
}

# Or it can make any necessary changes to the working tree and to the
# index to bring them to the desired state when the tip of the current
# branch is updated to the new commit, and exit with a zero status.
#
# For example, the hook can simply run git read-tree -u -m HEAD "$1"
# in order to emulate git fetch that is run in the reverse direction
# with git push, as the two-tree form of git read-tree -u -m is
# essentially the same as git switch or git checkout that switches
# branches while keeping the local changes in the working tree that do
# not interfere with the difference between the branches.

# The below is a more-or-less exact translation to shell of the C code
# for the default behaviour for git's push-to-checkout hook defined in
# the push_to_deploy() function in builtin/receive-pack.c.
#
# Note that the hook will be executed from the repository directory,
# not from the working tree, so if you want to perform operations on
# the working tree, you will have to adapt your code accordingly, e.g.
# by adding "cd .." or using relative paths.

# Books Ingest Service (microservicio de ingesta)

Servicio **FastAPI** que recibe un **PDF** de libro junto con su **ISBN**, consulta fuentes externas para obtener **personajes** y **lugares** (LibraryThing), descarga la **portada** y la **sube a Huawei Cloud OBS**, y persiste todo en una base **SQL**. Deja espacios **TODO** para completar más adelante título, autor, sinopsis y géneros desde otra API bibliográfica.

> Este servicio implementa la primera etapa del pipeline de Livrario: **ingesta + metadatos**. Prepara datos para los siguientes módulos (embeddings, RAG y generación de imágenes/skybox).

## Arquitectura breve

* **FastAPI** expone endpoints REST.
* **Requests** consulta:

  * **LibraryThing** (`librarything.ck.getwork`) para **personajes** (`characternames`) y **lugares** (`placesmentioned`).
  * **(TODO)** API bibliográfica externa para **título, autor, sinopsis, géneros**.
* **OBS (Huawei Cloud)**: se sube la **portada** (`covers/{ISBN}.jpg`) y el **PDF** (`books/{ISBN}/original.pdf`).
* **SQL (Postgres)**: persistencia normalizada de libro, autor, personajes, lugares y géneros.

```
PDF + ISBN ──► /ingest ──► LibraryThing (XML) ──► parseo personajes/lugares
                      └─► cover.longitood.com ──► descarga cover ─► OBS
                      └─► SQL upsert ─► books / authors / characters / places / genres
                      └─► TODO: completar título/autor/sinopsis/géneros desde otra API
```

---

## Endpoints

### 1) `POST /ingest`

**Multipart form-data**

* `isbn` *(string, requerido)*
* `libr_api_key` *(string, requerido)* — API key de **LibraryThing**

* `force_title` *(string, opcional)* — solo para pruebas hasta integrar API bibliográfica
* `force_author` *(string, opcional)* — idem

**Qué hace**

1. Sube el **PDF** a OBS → `books/{isbn}/original.pdf`.
2. Llama a **LibraryThing** y parsea `characternames` (personajes) y `placesmentioned` (lugares).
3. Descarga la **portada** desde `https://bookcover.longitood.com/bookcover/{isbn}` y la sube a OBS → `covers/{isbn}.jpg`.
4. Inserta/actualiza el **libro** en SQL y relaciona **personajes** y **lugares** (top 5).
5. Deja **TODO** para título/autor/sinopsis/géneros (o toma `force_*`).

**200 OK (JSON)**

```json
{
  "isbn": "9788491050219",
  "pdf_obs_key": "books/9788491050219/original.pdf",
  "cover_obs_key": "covers/9788491050219.jpg",

  "todos": {
    "title": "TODO desde otra API (o usar force_title)",
    "author": "TODO desde otra API (o usar force_author)",
    "author_description": "TODO desde otra API",
    "synopsis": "TODO desde otra API",
    "genres": "TODO desde otra API (top 3)"
  }
}
```

**4xx/5xx**: ver [Errores comunes](#errores-comunes).

---

### 2) `GET /books/{isbn}/author`

Devuelve **autor** y su **descripción** (si existe) asociados al ISBN.

  "isbn": "9788491050219",
  "author": {
    "id": 12,
    "name": "Nombre del Autor",
    "description": "Bio del autor (si está disponible)"
  }
}
```

**404** si no hay autor asociado aún.

---

### 3) `GET /books/{isbn}/cover`

Devuelve la **portada** desde OBS como **bytes** (`image/jpeg`).

**200 OK (image/jpeg)**: cuerpo binario de la imagen.

**404** si no hay `cover_obs_key` o si falla la descarga desde OBS.

---

### 4) `GET /books/{isbn}`

---

## Detalles de integración

* **LibraryThing**: se consulta `method=librarything.ck.getwork&isbn={ISBN}&apikey={KEY}` y se parsean los **XML** con `ElementTree`, extrayendo las secciones:

  * `<field name="characternames"> ... <factList><fact>Nombre</fact> ...` → **personajes**
  * `<field name="placesmentioned"> ... <factList><fact>Lugar</fact> ...` → **lugares** (se guardan **hasta 5** en orden)
* **Cover**: se obtiene de `https://bookcover.longitood.com/bookcover/{ISBN}`, se guarda en OBS como `covers/{ISBN}.jpg`.
* **OBS SDK** (`esdk-obs-python`): se usa `putContent` y `getObject(loadStreamInMemory=True)`.
* **TODO API bibliográfica**:

  * completar **título**, **autor**, **bio de autor**, **sinopsis** y **géneros** (hasta 3) y actualizar tablas.

---

## Errores comunes

* **400**: el archivo no es PDF, o faltan campos requeridos.
* **404**: ISBN inexistente en base, `cover_obs_key` ausente o fallo al recuperar desde OBS.
* **502**: error HTTP al consultar servicios externos (LibraryThing o cover).
* **500**: error interno (DB/OBS/parseo). Revisar logs de FastAPI.

---

## TODO / Próximos pasos

* Integrar **Open Library / Google Books / ISBNdb** para completar *título/autor/sinopsis/géneros*.
* Normalizar **géneros** y limitar a **top 3** coherentes.
* Validación de **ISBN** (ISBN-10/ISBN-13) y manejo de duplicados.
* Tests unitarios e integración (mocks para LibraryThing/OBS).
* Endpoint `POST /books/{isbn}/refresh-metadata` para re-hidratar datos.

# LIVRARIO — Plataforma de lectura inmersiva con IA

Este repositorio contiene los servicios y componentes de **Livrario**, una app orientada a mejorar la comprensión, el disfrute y la persistencia en la lectura de novelas para hispanohablantes, con foco en personas con afantasía y/o TDAH, mediante entornos inmersivos y asistencia con IA. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Visión y objetivos

- **Objetivo general:** promover comprensión, disfrute y persistencia en la lectura a través de una app de RV que represente escenarios y personajes. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- **Objetivos clave:**
  - Hub interactivo que cambia según el **género** (fantasía, ciencia ficción, policial). :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
  - **Imágenes y videos** de personajes + **escenas 360°** generadas por IA. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
  - **Seguimiento del progreso** (porcentaje leído). :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
  - **Chat inteligente** (RAG) que responde sin spoilers, limitado a lo ya leído. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

> En el estado del arte, no hay soluciones que integren **todo**: ambientaciones por género, generación de imágenes contextuales, chat sin spoilers y tracking de progreso en una sola plataforma. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7} :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

## Alcance (MVP)

- Hub de lectura en RV con ambientación por género (fantasía, ciencia ficción, policial).  
- Generación de imágenes de personajes y escenas 360°.
- Entorno que minimiza distracciones y seguimiento del progreso.  
- Chat inteligente para resúmenes/explicaciones **hasta el punto leído** (sin spoilers).

**Fuera de alcance** (posibles releases futuras): integración con plataformas externas, multijugador, idiomas adicionales, visualizaciones en tiempo real del texto completo, módulos de evaluación formal, etc.


## Stack

- **Backend**: Python + FastAPI
- **Persistencia**: Postgres
- **Object Storage**: Huawei Cloud **OBS**
- **Infra**: Docker / Docker Compose
- **IA**: Ollama (local) para LLM; pipelines de imágenes/skybox
